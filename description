Hello everyone,
This is Khushbu Kathuria and this project is for building snake game using python.

The steps that we are going to take to build this game are :-

1. installing pygame into your pc
2. creating the screen
3. creating the snake
4. moving the snake
5. game over when snake hits the boundaries
6. adding the food
7. increasing the length of the snake
8. displaying the score

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
step1: we are going to install pygame into pc
to do so just type 'pip install pygame' in your pc terminal.
(if after installation 'WARNING: You are using pip version 19.2.3, however version 20.0.2 is available.'
the above message is shown use 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command)

you must now have pygame installed.
